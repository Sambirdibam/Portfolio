          1. My First Week At Herald.
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h3>When I was sure about taking computer science as my undergraduate course. I was looking out for different colleges that provides best computer science course in Kathmandu then I get to know about Herald through my cousin and when I visited Herald it was perfect. I got to know more about college through counselling how the college inclined towards more practical knowledge than theoretical and other different facilities that is beneficial for my studies.

          When the first official day of college arrived, I was quite nervous and excited but because of UPC classes and orientation, I already had friends which was nice. On first day we had a lecture class of Academic Skills and Team Based Learning. The lecture was fun, informative for us. We got to know about necessary knowledge to survive our upcoming years in this college. We get to know how the university works and how the university want us students to work. On other days we had other lectures, we learned about basic programming and coding in java and afterwards we had a tutorial class for yesterdayâ€™s lecture where we learned about blog then after that we got holidays due to election and the college remained close for three days which includes Saturday. The college opened on Tuesday, where we had tutorial and workshop classes where we learn about different languages to communicate with computer however, the lecture we missed due to the holiday, we need to cover it by our own which was quite hectic but the teachers here are helpful and friendly that made our work smooth.
          
          Overall, the first week at college was good. I am still nervous and excited about my journey at Herald. I am excited about what my future holds. I hope my journey here will be smooth and fun.</h3>
